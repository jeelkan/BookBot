# BookBot ðŸ“šðŸ¤–
BookBot is an innovative AI-driven application that enhances user interaction with books by providing detailed insights, summaries, and responses based on text analysis. It leverages advanced AI models from OpenAI, including GPT-3.5 Turbo for conversational responses and Pinecone for retrieving book information and recommendations.

## How It Works

- **Book Metadata Retrieval**: BookBot retrieves detailed information about books, including titles, authors, publication years, and summaries, using a custom book metadata API based on Pinecone vector database.
- **AI-Driven Interaction**: Users can interact with the bot by asking questions about specific books. BookBot uses GPT-3.5-turbo to understand the context of the questions and generate accurate and relevant answers.

## Built With

- **Streamlit** - For creating and sharing beautiful data apps quickly.
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo** - For generating responses to user queries.
- **Pinecone** - Used to store books data in vector form and retrieve book information and recommendations based on vector score.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer.
- An OpenAI API key.
- A Pinecone API key.
- Streamlit installed.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeelkan/BookBot.git
```

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up Environment Variables

Before running the application, you need to set up necessary environment variables. Specifically, you need to set your OpenAI API key to enable AI functionalities. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up based on your operating system:

For Windows
```bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
set PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
```

For macOS and Linux
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
export PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
```

Make sure to replace your_openai_api_key_here with your actual OpenAI API key.


### Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage
Interact through the UI: Use the sidebar to search for books and view detailed metadata. Navigate to the interaction section to chat with BookBot about the book details.
Ask Questions or Get Summaries: You can ask specific questions about any book's content or get a summary of other books or authors.
